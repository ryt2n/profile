    I like learning and making a difference at my relative scale.  I think digital is an incredible opportunity to do both 🚀.
    While I have had a career in digital marketing for the past 19 years, I am currently back to school learning full stack developping at <a href="www.lewagon.com">Le Wagon</a>.
    <p>
    Through out the years digital marketing has had to become more and more relevant and customers journeys need to be laser sharp.  This requires marketing to become more technical and integrated with the digital product.  I want to be part of this trend.
